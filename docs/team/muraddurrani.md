### 5.4 View feature

The `view` feature allows the user to view the contact details of a specified person in the address book, as well as 
meetings the user has with that person. The command is only available from the Home Page, and is facilitated by the
`HomePageParser`, `ViewCommandParser`, and `ViewCommand`. Additionally, it implements the following operation:

* `MainWindow#LoadContactDetailsPage(Person personToDisplay)` — Constructs a `ContactDetailsPanel` and a
  `ContactMeetingsPanel` for the specified `personToDisplay`,and displays them in the `MainWindow`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the _view_ mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. From the Home Page, the user executes `view 2` to view the contact details of the second person in the address
book. A `ViewCommand` is constructed with the index of the person to de displayed.

Step 2. The `ViewCommand` is executed, and the person that corresponds to the provided index is returned to `MainWindow`
inside a `CommandResult`.

Step 3. `MainWindow#loadContactDetailsPage(Person personToDisplay)` is executed with the specified person passed as
argument, which constructs and displays the respective `ContactDetailsPanel` and `ContactMeetingsPanel`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the _view_ feature works:

```markdown
Upon launching Reache, you will see the Main Window, which is depicted below. The Main Window displays your entire contact
list as well as all upcoming meetings you have planned.

![Main Window](/images/MainWindow.png)

The Main Window contains the following elements:
1. **Menu Bar**: Contains Reache's options and help.
2. **Command Box**: A dialog box from which you can type commands to use Reache.
3. **Result Display**: When you use the Command Box to enter a command, Reache will show the result of that command here.
4. **Contact List**: A list of all your contacts, sorted alphabetically. Each contact has a corresponding index number, 
   which you can use to refer to that contact in commands.
5. **Meeting List**: A list of all your upcoming meetings, sorted chronologically. As with contacts, each meeting has a 
   corresponding index number for use in commands.
```
