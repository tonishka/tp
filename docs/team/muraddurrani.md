### View person feature

The view feature allows the user to view the full contact details of a specified person in the address book. The command is only available from the person list window,and is thus facilitated by the `AddressBookParser`, 
`ViewCommandParser`, and `ViewCommand`. Additionally, it implements the following operation:

* `MainWindow#LoadContactScreen(Person personToDisplay)` — Constructs and shows a `ContactDetailsPanel`, which displays the full details of the `Person` provided as argument.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the view mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. From the person list window, the user executes `view 2` to view the contact details of the second person in the address book. A `ViewCommand` is constructed with the index of the person to de displayed.

Step 2. The `ViewCommand` is executed, and the person that corresponds to the provided index is returned to the `MainWindow` inside a `CommandResult`.

Step 3. `MainWindow#loadContactScreen(Person personToDisplay)` is executed with the specified person passed as argument, which constructs and displays the respective `ContactDetailsPanel`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the view feature works:

Upon launching Reache, you will see the Main Window, which is depicted below. The Main Window displays your entire contact list as well as all upcoming meetings you have planned.

![Main Window](/images/MainWindow.png)

The Main Window contains the following elements:
1. **Menu Bar**: Contains Reache's options and help.
2. **Command Box**: A dialog box from which you can type commands to use Reache.
3. **Result Display**: When you use the Command Box to enter a command, Reache will show the result of that command here.
4. **Contact List**: A list of all your contacts, sorted alphabetically. Each contact has a corresponding index number, which you can use to refer to that contact in commands.
5. **Meeting List**: A list of all your upcoming meetings, sorted chronologically. As with contacts, each meeting has a corresponding index number for use in commands.
```
