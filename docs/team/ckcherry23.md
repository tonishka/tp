## Summary of Contribution

* **Code Contributed**: [RepoSense Link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2122s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=ckcherry23&breakdown=true&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2022-02-18&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other)

<br>

* **Enhancements Implemented**: 
  * Implemented a new feature to `delete` specific fields of a contact:
  [#81](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W12-4/tp/pull/81).

  * Enhanced the `clear` command by asking for user confirmation. Created a new `ConfirmWindow` with reusability in 
  mind for any future commands that require user confirmation:
  [#82](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W12-4/tp/pull/82).

  * Implemented storage functionality for the persons list and meetings list:
  [#44](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W12-4/tp/pull/44), 
  [#122](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W12-4/tp/pull/122).

  * Enhanced the `help` command by opening the user guide directly from the _Help Window_ rather than allowing the user 
  to copy the user guide URL to improve UX:
  [#36](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W12-4/tp/pull/36).
  
  * Implemented changes to allow creation of contacts with the same name as long as tags are different. This takes into 
  consideration that multiple contacts may have the same full name, but still helps us keep our contacts unique:
  [#96](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W12-4/tp/pull/96).
  
  * Implemented setting focus to the command box after navigation to decrease number of mouse clicks and improve UX:
  [#131](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W12-4/tp/pull/131).
  
  * Implemented the `back` command that takes the user back to the _MainWindow_ from the _Contact Details Window_:
  [#76](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W12-4/tp/pull/76).
  
  * Fixed tests after the implementation of multiple fields for phones, addresses and emails: 
  [#39](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W12-4/tp/pull/39),
  [#46](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W12-4/tp/pull/46).
  
  * Updated the GUI color scheme: 
  [#218](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W12-4/tp/pull/218).

### Clear address book feature
The **clear address book** feature can be used to delete all the contacts stored by 
the user and to start with a new address book. Since deleted data cannot be recovered, 
the app opens a pop-up window asking for confirmation that the user wants to delete 
all of their stored contacts.

The following sequence diagram shows how the clear operation works:

This activity diagram summarises the possible paths of executing the _clear_ command:
