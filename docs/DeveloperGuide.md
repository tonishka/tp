## **Introduction**

Reache is a desktop application that helps busy working professionals manage their large list of contacts by providing an easy-to-use interface to store contacts and organize meetings.

This Developer Guide is intended for the future software developers and designers of Reache, and serves to describe the software architecture of Reache and explain decisions made in the implementation of its features.

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Edit feature
The edit mechanism is a feature used to change the details of the contacts. It is only allowed in the application after initiating an add command or view command and in other words, it is functional only in the contact details windows. It is facilitated mainly by the `ContactDetailsParser`, `EditCommandParser` and `EditCommand` classes.

The following sequence diagram shows how the edit operation works:

![EditCommandSequenceDiagram](images/EditCommandSequenceDiagram.png)
- Here, the user executes an add command which takes in a new name input "Jack" which is tagged with a prefix "n/" for input type identification.
- If a user were to execute a view command instead, the only difference would be that the editing is done on an existing contact instead of a new one.

![DetailedParsingForEditSequenceDiagram](images/DetailedParsingForEditSequenceDiagram.png)

Below is an activity diagram summarising the possible paths for an edit command:

![EditActivityDiagram](images/EditActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How edit saves:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Each edit is saved immediately.
    * Pros: Prevents data loss from system crashes.
    * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2 :** All edits are saved only after executing a save command (not implemented feature).
    * Pros: Allows user to revert their changes
    * Cons: System crashes will not save the edits.

### Delete fields feature
The **delete fields** feature can be used to delete fields stored for the contacts. 
This feature is also restricted to the Contact Details screen (in _edit_ mode), 
which can be accessed after the _add_ or _view_ commands. 
It is mainly facilitated by the `ContactDetailsParser`, `DeleteFieldCommandParser` and `DeleteFieldCommand` classes.

<ins>Note</ins>: This feature is different from the **delete contacts** feature, 
which is only accessible on the Person Details screen (in _default_ mode).

The _delete fields_ operation works similar to the _edit_ operation, except for:
1. the deletion functionality 
2. the parsing of the command

The deletion functionality sets the fields to return to their initial empty values.
It is illustrated in the code snippets below:

```java
    // Single-valued fields
    if (argMultimap.getValue(PREFIX_COMPANY).isPresent()) {
        deleteFieldDescriptor.setCompany(null);
    }
```
```java
    // Multi-valued fields
    if (deleteFieldDescriptor.getNumbers().isPresent()) {
        Collection<String> numbersToBeDeleted = argMultimap.getAllValues(PREFIX_PHONE);
    
        requireNonNull(numbersToBeDeleted);
    
        if (CollectionUtil.hasEmptyString(numbersToBeDeleted)) {
            deleteFieldDescriptor.setNumbers(new HashMap<String, Phone>());
        } else {
            Map<String, Phone> numbers = new HashMap<>(deleteFieldDescriptor.getNumbers()
                    .orElse(new HashMap<>()));
            numbersToBeDeleted.forEach(numbers::remove);
            deleteFieldDescriptor.setNumbers(numbers);
        }
    }
```

#### Design considerations:
Since certain fields allow for multiple values to be stored, 
the user needs to specify the label of the value (or the value itself for non-labelled fields) 
they want to delete along with the field to be deleted for such fields.

**Aspect: What happens when the user does not specify a label or value:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Delete all the values stored for this field immediately.
    * Pros:
      * Seems to be the most intuitive approach.
      * Easier to implement.
      * Faster to execute command.
    * Cons:
      * User may have forgotten to mention the label or field, which could lead to unintended loss of data.

* **Alternative 2 :** Confirm that the user wants to delete all values for this field
    * Pros:
      * Allows user to cancel the command if it was unintentional.
    * Cons:
      * Slower to execute command.
      * Difficult to implement, since the current implementation does not store command history.

We picked _alternative 1_ since the focus of our CLI app is on speed and efficiency. Additionally, _alternative 2_ required a lot of changes to the existing implementation which would not be very helpful for executing other commands.

### Clear address book feature
The **clear address book** feature can be used to delete all the contacts stored by the user 
and to start with a new address book. Since deleted data cannot be recovered, 
the app opens a pop-up window asking for confirmation that 
the user wants to delete all of their stored contacts.

The following sequence diagram shows how the clear operation works:

![ClearSequenceDiagram](images/ClearSequenceDiagram.png)

This activity diagram summarises the possible paths of executing the _clear_ command:

![ClearActivityDiagram](images/ClearActivityDiagram.png)

### View person feature

The view feature allows the user to view the full contact details of a specified person in the address book. The command is only available from the person list window,and is thus facilitated by the `AddressBookParser`, `ViewCommandParser`, and `ViewCommand`. Additionally, it implements the following operation:

* `MainWindow#LoadContactScreen(Person personToDisplay)`â€‰â€”â€‰Constructs and shows a `ContactDetailsPanel`, which displays the full details of the `Person` provided as argument.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the view mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. From the person list window, the user executes `view 2` to view the contact details of the second person in the address book. A `ViewCommand` is constructed with the index of the person to de displayed.

Step 2. The `ViewCommand` is executed, and the person that corresponds to the provided index is returned to the `MainWindow` inside a `CommandResult`.

Step 3. `MainWindow#loadContactScreen(Person personToDisplay)` is executed with the specified person passed as argument, which constructs and displays the respective `ContactDetailsPanel`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the view feature works:

![ViewSequenceDiagram](images/ViewCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: Where to display a person's contact details:**

* **Alternative 1:** Display all contact information in the person list screen.
  * Pros:
    * Easy to implement
    * Does not require the user to navigate to a new screen, which speeds up program use
  * Cons:
    * Clutters the person list screen with a lot of information for each person
    
* **Alternative 2 (current choice):** Navigate to a new screen to for contact information
  * Pros:
    * Greatly reduces clutter in the person list screen
    * Reduces the size of the person list, making it easier to scroll through
  * Cons:
    * Difficult to implement
    * Slower program use due to the addition of an additional navigation step
    
We chose alternative 2 because its benefit to the visual clarity of the address book and thus the ease of its use outweighs the cost of including an additional navigation step.

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

### \[Proposed\] Data archiving

_{Explain here how the data archiving feature will be implemented}_

### Find feature

#### Implementation

The find command is used to search for people based on certain criteria.
<br> {More details to be added later}

Below is a sequence diagram summarising the mechanism of find command:

![FindSequencdDiagaram](images/FindSequenceDiagram.png)

Below is an activity diagram summarising the possible paths for a find command:

![FindActivityDiagram](images/FindActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design Considerations

#### Aspect: How keywords are matched

- **Alternative 1 (Current Choice):** Ignore case and full match is required <br>
  - Pros:
    - Easy to implement. 
    - It gives the best performance if the user remembers the exact keyword they are searching for.
  - Cons: Weak matching, i.e., `abc` does not match with `ab`. The current implementation would be less useful if the user 
  remembers only some part of the search keywords.

- **Alternative 2:** Ignore case but full match is not required <br>
  - Pros: Strong matching, would be especially helpful if the user remembers only bits and pieces of search keywords.
  - Cons: Difficult and time-consuming to implement.

#### Aspect: What happens when user does not specify a field

**Note:** <br> 
For evaluating the usefulness of the alternatives these are the assumptions made as to why the user does not specify 
the field: <br>
a) they forgot, <br>
b) they do not want to restrict their search to one field, or <br>
c) they do not remember which field they want to search.

**Alternative 1 (Current Choice):** Search all fields for the keyword <br>
- Pros:
  - This is the most intuitive approach. 
  - For all above mentioned scenarios a-c, this alternative is will produce the most useful result.
- Cons:
  - If there is a lot of data it will take more time to search all fields for every person.
  - Requires the most complex implementation among all alternatives. 
  - Performs a lot of unnecessary comparisons (`alex` will never match any phone number, likewise `659347563` will 
  never match any name). 

**Alternative 2:** Use name as the default search field
- Pros: Simple implementation. Since searching people by their name is the most probable and intuitive use of this command, this is likely to produce a useful result.
- Cons: Useless for scenario b) and c).

**Alternative 3:** Produce a command syntax error and ask user to enter field
- Pros: Simple implementation. Useful in scenario a) above.
- Cons: Useless for scenario b) and c).
