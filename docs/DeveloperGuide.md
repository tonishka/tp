## **1. Introduction**

Reache is a desktop application that helps busy working professionals manage their large list of contacts by providing an easy-to-use interface to store contacts and organize meetings.

This Developer Guide is intended for the future software developers and designers of Reache, and serves to describe the software architecture of Reache and explain decisions made in the implementation of its features.

### 4.1 Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W12-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W12-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### 4.2 UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W12-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that comprises several UI parts. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The specific UI parts that make up the `MainWindow` depend on which page of the application is being displayed. Reache contains two pages:
* **The Home Page**: Displays lists of the user's contacts and the user's upcoming meetings. The below diagram depicts the `MainWindow` when the Home Page is being displayed.

![Home Page UI Parts](images/HomePageDiagram.png)

* **The Contact Details Page**: Displays the details of a specific contact, as well as upcoming meetings associated with that contact. The below diagram depicts the `MainWindow` when the Contact Details page is being displayed.

![Contact Details Page UI Parts](images/ContactDetailsPageDiagram.png)

Note that the `PersonListPanel` and `MeetingListPanel` are replaced by the `ContactDetailsPanel` and `ContactMeetingsPanel` when the Contact Details Page is displayed.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W12-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W12-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### 4.3 Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W12-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses one of two parsers to process the user command. If the command is entered from the Home Page, it is parsed by `HomePageParser`. If it is entered from the Contact Details Page, it is parsed by `ContactDetailsPageParser`.
2. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`. The only commands whose creation is specific to the `ContactDetailsPageParser` class are the `EditCommand` ,`DeleteFieldCommand` and `BackCommand`  classes. General commands applicable to both parsers are the `ExitCommand` and `HelpCommand` classes. 
3. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `HomePageParser` or `ContactDetailsPageParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `HomePageParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### 4.4 Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W12-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

We have divided the class diagram of the `Model` component into two parts for better understandability. <br>
The first diagram below illustrates the `Model` component's structure for storing `Person` objects.

![Person Model Class Diagram](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

The second diagram below illustrates the `Model` component's structure for storing `Meeting` objects. It is worthwhile to note that `Meeting` objects are associated to `Id` objects (each `Id` uniquely identifies each `Person`) so that updates to `AddressBook` do not affect the list of people in a `Meeting`.

![Meeting Model Class Diagram](images/MeetingModelClassDiagram.png)

The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the meeting book data i.e., all `Meeting` objects (which are contained in a `MeetingsList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

### 4.5 Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W12-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

![StorageClassDiagram](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

Here are the other classes that were omitted from the diagram above but are useful to take note of:

![JsonAdapedPersonDiagram](images/JsonAdaptedPerson.png)

![JsonAdaptedMeetingDiagram](images/JsonAdaptedMeeting.png)

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book, meeting book and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from `AddressBookStorage`, `MeetingBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### 4.6 Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **5. Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### 5.1 General Design Considerations
Listed below are a few significant decisions we made in designing Reache, and their implications for program use.

* **Decision**: Allow the user to store the same phone number twice under different labels. For example, A contact can have one instance of the number "87654321" saved with the label "Personal" and one instance saved with the label "Office".
  * Pros:
    * The user may wish to make explicit that a contact uses the same number for two purposes

  * Cons:
    * Presents the risk of the user accidentally storing the same number twice. An occurrence of this accident would be relatively easy to spot on the Contact Details Page, where all numbers appear in a list

<br>

* **Decision**: Allow multiple contacts to have the same name, so long as their tags differ.
  * Pros:
    * If the user does know two people that share the same full name, they can include them both in their contact list without conflict by giving each person different tags
  * Cons:
    * The user may accidentally add the same contact twice. This risk is partially alleviated by the need for different tags, and because contacts are sorted alphabetically, an occurrence of this accident would be relatively easy to spot

<br>

* **Decision**: Allow phone numbers to be of varying lengths, as long as they are over 3 digits.
  * Pros:
    * Different countries have different standard phone number lengths, so allowing different lengths makes Reache more suitable for international users
  * Cons:
    * In Singapore, where the application was developed, the lack of restriction on phone number length could give rise to user mistakes

  
### 5.2 Edit feature
The edit mechanism is a feature used to change the details of a contact. It is only accessible from the Contact Details Page, and so must be preceded by an _add_ or _view_ command, both of which navigate the user to the Contact Details Page. It is facilitated mainly by the `ContactDetailsPageParser`, `EditCommandParser` and `EditCommand` classes.

The following sequence diagram shows how the edit operation works:

![EditCommandSequenceDiagram](images/EditCommandSequenceDiagram.png)
- Here, the user executes an `EditCommand`, and supplies the argument `n/Jack`, meaning they wish to change the name of `personToEdit` to "Jack".


![DetailedParsingForEditSequenceDiagram](images/DetailedParsingForEditSequenceDiagram.png)


Below is an activity diagram summarising the possible paths leading to and during the execution of an `EditCommand`:

![EditActivityDiagram](images/EditActivityDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** Similar to adding a contact, the contact edited cannot have the same **Name** and **Tags** as an existing contact in the addressbook. This is meant to protect against duplicate contacts which may result in confusion for the user in managing their contacts. Attempting to do so will result in a warning message to the user which reads "A person with these details already exists. Please do add tags that differentiate between them!"

</div>

#### 5.2.1 Design considerations:

**Aspect: How edit saves:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Each edit is saved immediately.
    * Pros: Prevents data loss from system crashes.
    * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2 :** All edits are saved only after executing a save command (not implemented feature).
    * Pros: Allows user to revert their changes
    * Cons: System crashes will not save the edits.

We chose to use alternative 1 in our implementation because in manually using the application and assessing its performance, we found that manually saving after every edit did not make a meaningful difference to performance and would not affect user experience.

### 5.3 Delete fields feature
The **delete fields** feature can be used to delete fields stored for the contacts. 
This feature is also restricted to the Contact Details Page, 
which can be accessed after the _add_ or _view_ commands. 
It is mainly facilitated by the `ContactDetailsPageParser`, `DeleteFieldCommandParser` and `DeleteFieldCommand` classes.

_Note:_ This feature is different from the **delete contacts** feature, 
which is only accessible on the Home Page.

#### 5.3.1 Design considerations:
Since certain fields allow for multiple values to be stored, 
the user needs to specify the label of the value (or the value itself for non-labelled fields) 
they want to delete along with the field to be deleted for such fields.

**Aspect: What happens when the user does not specify a label or value:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Delete all the values stored for this field immediately.
    * Pros:
      * Seems to be the most intuitive approach.
      * Easier to implement.
      * Faster to execute command.
    * Cons:
      * User may have forgotten to mention the label or field, which could lead to unintended loss of data.


* **Alternative 2 :** Confirm that the user wants to delete all values for this field
    * Pros:
      * Allows user to cancel the command if it was unintentional.
    * Cons:
      * Slower to execute command.
      * Difficult to implement, since the current implementation does not store command history.

We picked _alternative 1_ since the focus of our CLI app is on speed and efficiency. 
Additionally, _alternative 2_ required a lot of changes to the existing implementation which would not be 
very helpful for executing other commands.


### 5.4 Clear all data feature
The **clear all data** feature can be used to delete all the contacts 
and meetings stored by the user. Since deleted data cannot be recovered, 
the app opens a pop-up window asking for user confirmation before any 
data is cleared.

The following sequence diagram shows how the clear operation works:

![ClearSequenceDiagram](images/ClearSequenceDiagram.png)

This activity diagram summarises the possible paths of executing the _clear_ 
command:

![ClearActivityDiagram](images/ClearActivityDiagram.png)

### 5.5 View feature

The `view` feature allows the user to view the contact details of a specified person in the address book, as well as meetings the user has with that person. The command is only available from the Home Page, and is facilitated by the `HomePageParser`, `ViewCommandParser`, and `ViewCommand`. Additionally, it implements the following operation:

* `MainWindow#LoadContactDetailsPage(Person personToDisplay)` — Constructs a `ContactDetailsPanel` and a `ContactMeetingsPanel` for the specified `personToDisplay`,and displays them in the `MainWindow`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the _view_ mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. From the Home Page, the user executes `view 2` to view the contact details of the second person in the address book. A `ViewCommand` is constructed with the index of the person to de displayed.

Step 2. The `ViewCommand` is executed, and the person that corresponds to the provided index is returned to `MainWindow` inside a `CommandResult`.

Step 3. `MainWindow#loadContactDetailsPage(Person personToDisplay)` is executed with the specified person passed as argument, which constructs and displays the respective `ContactDetailsPanel` and `ContactMeetingsPanel`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the _view_ feature works:

![ViewSequenceDiagram](images/ViewCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

#### 5.5.1 Design considerations:

**Aspect: Where to display a person's contact details:**

* **Alternative 1:** Display all contact information in the Home Page.
  * Pros:
    * Easy to implement
    * Requires fewer commands from the user as they do not need to navigate to a new screen to view a contact's information
  * Cons:
    * Between phone numbers, emails, addresses, job titles, and more, a contact can have a large amount of information associated with it. Displaying all that information in the Home Page would add a lot of clutter
    
* **Alternative 2 (current choice):** Navigate to a new screen to for contact information
  * Pros:
    * Greatly reduces clutter in the Home Page
    * Reduces the length of the contact list, making it easier and faster to scroll through
  * Cons:
    * More difficult to implement
    * Requires an additional command from the user to both view a contact's information and return to the Home Page after
    
We chose alternative 2 for two reasons:
* Its benefit to the visual clarity of the address book and thus the ease of its use outweighs the cost of including an additional navigation step
* Given the quantity of information a contact can have associated with it, having to scroll through a cluttered and much longer list could take the user more time than simply navigating to a new page

### 5.6 Find feature

The `find` command is used to search people's contact information for a particular keyword. It takes an optional argument which is the
field that the user wishes to search. The `find` command is mainly facilitated by the `FindCommand`, `FindCommandParser`, and 
`FieldContainsKeywordsPredicate` classes.

Below is a sequence diagram summarising the mechanism of the _find_ command:

![Find Sequence Diagram](images/FindSequenceDiagram.png)

Below is an activity diagram summarising the possible paths for a `find` command:

![Find Activity Diagram](images/FindActivityDiagram.png)

#### 5.6.1 Design Considerations

**Aspect: How keywords are matched**

* **Alternative 1 (Current Choice):** Ignore case and full match is required <br>
  - Pros:
    - Easy to implement. 
    - It gives the best performance if the user remembers the exact keyword they are searching for.
  - Cons: Weak matching, i.e., `abc` does not match with `ab`. The current implementation would be less useful if the user 
  remembers only some part of the search keywords.

* **Alternative 2:** Ignore case but full match is not required <br>
    - Pros: Strong matching, would be especially helpful if the user remembers only bits and pieces of search keywords.
    - Cons: Difficult and time-consuming to implement.

**Aspect: What happens when user does not specify a field**

**Note:** <br> 
For evaluating the usefulness of the alternatives these are the assumptions made as to why the user does not specify 
the field: <br>
a) they forgot, <br>
b) they do not want to restrict their search to one field, or <br>
c) they do not remember which field they want to search.

* **Alternative 1 (Current Choice):** Search all fields for the keyword <br>
  - Pros:
    - This is the most intuitive approach. 
    - For all above mentioned scenarios a-c, this alternative is will produce the most useful result.
  - Cons:
    - If there is a lot of data it will take more time to search all fields for every person.
    - Requires the most complex implementation among all alternatives. 
    - Performs a lot of unnecessary comparisons (`alex` will never match any phone number, likewise `659347563` will 
    never match any name). 

* **Alternative 2:** Use name as the default search field
  - Pros: Simple implementation. Since searching people by their name is the most probable and intuitive use of this command, this is likely to produce a useful result.
  - Cons: Useless for scenario b) and c).

* **Alternative 3:** Produce a command syntax error and ask user to enter field
  - Pros: Simple implementation. Useful in scenario a) above.
  - Cons: Useless for scenario b) and c).


### 5.7 Meet Feature

The `meet` feature allows the user to schedule meetings having an `Agenda`, a `Meeting Time`, a `Meeting Place`, and 
`Meeting Attendees`. The `meet` command can only be issued from the `Home Page`. It is facilitated by such classes as
`HomePageParser`, `MeetCommandParser`, and `MeetCommand`.

Below is a sequence diagram summarising the mechanism of the `meet` feature:

![Meet Command Sequence Diagram](images/MeetCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

#### 5.7.1 Design Considerations

#### Aspect: Creation of multiple meetings at the same time
* **Alternative 1 (Current Choice):** Multiple different meetings can be created at the same time
  * Pros: 
    * Gives the user greater flexibility in deciding their schedule. 
    * When users have conflicting meetings, they should have the 
    freedom to add both of them to Reache and decide later which one they want to attend. 
    * It is also possible that some users may
    attend more than one meeting simultaneously (such as when they are online). 
  * Cons: Users may unknowingly add conflicting meetings.
* **Alternative 2:** Only one meeting is allowed to be created at a given time
  * Pros: Prevents the user from unknowingly adding conflicting meetings.
  * Cons: 
    * Affords the user less flexibility in deciding their schedule. 
    * If a user wants to schedule multiple meetings but decide
    later which ones they want to keep, they are unable to do so. The user will have to go through the additional step of cancelling 
    the original meeting first before scheduling another at the same time.

#### Aspect: Specifying the domain of meeting attendees
* **Alternative 1 (Current Choice):** Only people whose have been added to Reache can be attendees in a meeting
  * Pros: 
    * Compels the user to be proactive in adding their contacts to Reache. 
    * If the user enters a non-existent index they are alerted of the fact and can rectify the command by adding valid
    attendees.
  * Cons:
    * User will have to add all attendees to Reache before they can schedule a meeting with them.
* **Alternative 2:** Anyone can be an attendee, but those who have not been added will be listed as `Unknown Attendee`
  * Pros: 
    * The users can add attendees to meetings that do not yet exist in Reache.
  * Cons:
    * If the user makes a genuine mistake of specifying a non-existent index, Reache will not alert the user of their error and instead create
    a meeting with an `Unknown Attendee`. This will lead to the wrong attendees being associated with a meeting.
    
#### Aspect: What happens when a meeting attendee is deleted 
* **Alternative 1 (Current Choice):** The `Meetings` panel will show the attendee as `Unknown Attendee` in the meeting description 
  * Pros: The user has a visual indication that they have deleted the contact information of a potentially relevant person.
  * Cons: More challenging to implement than **Alternative 2**.
* **Alternative 2:** The `Meetings` panel will not show any information about the attendee in the meeting description
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: Mislead the user about the number of attendees in the meeting. 

#### Aspect: What happens to meetings once they are expired
* **Alternative 1 (Current Choice):** Expired meetings are removed from the `Meetings` panel everytime the application is loaded
  * Pros: 
    * Prevents cluttering in the `Meetings` panel by removing meetings that are irrelevant.
    * User does not have to go through the additional step of cancelling each expired meeting to prevent cluttering.
  * Cons:
    * Users will be unable to see the details of past meetings if they wish to do so.
* **Alternative 2:** Expired meetings are not removed from the `Meetings` panel
  * Pros: 
    * Users can see details of their past meetings.
  * Cons:
    * Leads to cluttering in the `Meetings` panel.
    * Meetings are shown to the user in a chronological order so that they can see their upcoming schedule. Not automatically removing expired meetings will
      lead to loss of utility because the user has to scroll through countless expired meetings to find their upcoming schedule.

### 5.8 Update Feature

The `update` feature allows the user to update the details of the meetings that they have scheduled. The `update` command can only be issued from the `Home Page`. It is facilitated by such classes as
`HomePageParser`, `UpdateCommandParser`, and `UpdateCommand`.

Below is a sequence diagram summarising the mechanism of the `update` feature:

![Update Sequence Diagram](images/UpdateCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

#### 5.8.1 Design Considerations

The important design decisions made for `update` command are the same as design decisions made for `meet` command above.
Meetings updated using the `update` command are subject to the same constraints as if they were added directly using the `meet` command.

### 8.14 Saving data

1. Dealing with missing/corrupted data files

   1. Prerequisite for each test case: Must have at least one contact stored in `data/addressbook.json` and one meeting 
      stored in `data/meetingbook.json`. You can add this data to the files by using the `add` and `meet` commands on 
      the Reache application.
   
   2. Test case: Delete the `addressbook.json` file and run the program. <br>
      Expected: The application will start with both sample contacts and a sample meeting.
   
   3. Test case: Delete the `meetingbook.json` file and run the program. <br>
      Expected: The application will retain its stored contacts but the meetings list will be empty.
   
   4. Test case: Add a valid phone number (more than 3 digits) with any non-empty label in `addressbook.json` for an 
      existing contact and run the program. For example, you can add `"Landline": "32449877"`.
   
      <p align="center">
        <img src="images/testing/add_valid_number.png" width="550" />
      </p>
   
      Expected: The application will have the new number associated with the contact it was added to. You can verify 
      this by using the `view` command on the contact you added the phone number to and checking their numbers list.
   
   5. Test case: Add an invalid phone number (having alphabets and symbols) with any label in `addressbook.json` for an 
      existing contact and run the program. For example, you can add `"Landline": "landline number"`. <br>
      Expected: The application will discard all existing data and start without any stored contacts or meetings.
   
   6. Test case: Remove the attendees of an existing meeting in `meetingbook.json`.

      <p align="center">
        <img src="images/testing/remove_attendees.png" width="550" />
      </p>
   
      Expected: The application will discard all existing data and start without any stored contacts or meetings.
