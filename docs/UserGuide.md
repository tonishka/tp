Reache is a desktop app that helps busy working professionals manage their large list of contacts by providing an easy-to-use interface to store contacts and organize meetings. Reache is especially suited for professionals who would like to optimize their contact management by using a Command Line Interface (CLI).


This guide will familiarize you with Reache's interface and features, and provide you all the information you need to begin using Reache.

## 2. Introduction
### 2.1 Overview
Reache is a contact manager application that helps you:
- Store and organize contacts
- Easily sort and search through your contact list
- Plan and keep track of upcoming meetings

<br>

### 2.2 Interface Guide
Reache uses **two windows**, the [Main Window](#221-main-window) and the 
[Contact Details Window](#222-contact-details-window) as a means of maintaning **information segregation**. 
The `Main Window` displays only the `names` and `tags` which is our predetermined basic requirement for 
contact identification, while the `Contact Details Window` displays the more detailed information inside a 
specific contact. You could imagine this layout as **resembling looking through a folder with small identification 
tags sticking out and only pulling out the document with the tag when you want to view its details**. This would help 
to save space on the main window as well as preventing information overload.


#### 2.2.1 Main Window
Upon launching Reache, you will see the Main Window, which is depicted below. The Main Window displays your entire contact list as well as all upcoming meetings you have planned.

![Main Window](images/MainWindow.png)

The Main Window contains the following elements:
1. **Menu Bar**: Contains Reache's options and help.
2. **Command Box**: A dialog box from which you can type commands to use Reache.
3. **Result Display**: When you use the Command Box to enter a command, Reache will show the result of that command here.
4. **Contact List**: A list of all your contacts, sorted alphabetically. Each contact has a corresponding index number, which you can use to refer to that contact in commands.
5. **Meeting List**: A list of all your upcoming meetings, sorted chronologically. As with contacts, each meeting has a corresponding index number for use in commands.

<br>

#### 2.2.2 Contact Details Window
The Contact Details Window, which is depicted below, displays all the contact information associated with a specific contact.

![Contact Details Window](images/ContactDetailsWindow.png)

The Contact Details Window contains many of the same elements as the Main Window, like the Menu Bar, Command Box, and Result Display. In addition, it contains the following elements:
1. **Particulars**: Consists of their name, pronouns, job title, company, and tags. Tags are descriptive keywords that help you identify a person. For example, you might assign a contact the tag “Friend” to indicate that they are your friend.


2. **Contact Information**: A contact's phone numbers, email addresses, and physical addresses. Reache lets you assign *custom labels* to these fields to help you organize a contact's information. For example, a person might have a *personal* phone number and an *office* phone number.


3. **Meetings with Contact**: Whereas the Meeting List in the Main Window displays all your upcoming meetings, the Contact Details Window only displays upcoming meetings that involve the contact being viewed.

Now that you are familiar with Reache's interface, we recommend visiting [Getting Started With Reache](#23-getting-started-with-reache) to begin using the application.

#### 2.3.1 Tutorial 1: Managing Contacts with Reache

In this tutorial we will be adding your personal contact information to Reache.

1. Launch Reache from the folder in which it is located by double clicking on it. You will see the window shown below with some sample contacts. <br>
![Sample Contacts](images/Tutorial/sample_contacts_screen.png)
   Since this is the first time you are using Reache, it loads the sample contacts as there are no actual contacts stored. Let’s start storing some real contacts in it. <br><br>
2. Firstly, we have to clear the sample data first. Type `clear` in the command box and press Enter/Return. Press 'Yes’ when Reache asks for confirmation. <br><br>
3. Now that the sample data has been cleared, we can start adding some real contacts to it. <br><br>
4. Begin by typing `add n/<YOUR NAME>` in the command box. Press enter/return. <br><br>
5. You will be redirected to the **Contacts Details Window** as shown below: 
![Contact Details Window](images/Tutorial/contact_details_page.png)
**Note**: `edit` commands can only be issued in the **Contacts Details Window.** <br><br>
6. Let’s add your company and job to it. Type `edit j/<YOUR JOB> c/<YOUR COMPANY>`. Again, press enter/return. You will see your newly entered information on the window, as shown below:
![Company & Job Added](images/Tutorial/company_job_edited_screen.png)
7. Let’s add your emails to it. Type `edit e/<YOUR PERSONAL EMAIL> l/Personal e/<YOUR WORK EMAIL> l/Work`. The updated contact details should look like this:
![Email Added](images/Tutorial/email_edited_screen.png)
8. Let’s add your number to it. Type `edit ph/<YOUR MOBILE NUMBER> l/Mobile`. <br><br>
9. Finally tag yourself using `edit t/me`. Your final contact details window should look like this:
![Full Contact Details](images/Tutorial/tag_added.png)
10. Now type `back` in the command box to return to the main window. Your **Main Window** should look like this:
![Main Window](images/Tutorial/main_window.png)
11. Now type `view 1` in the command box to navigate to your contact details. <br><br>
12. Use more `edit` commands to edit your details as you wish. When you are done, type `back` to save the data and return to the Main Window. <br><br>
13. As additional practice, try adding more contacts using `add` and `edit`. When you are done, type `list` to view all saved contacts.

#### 2.3.2 Tutorial 2: Managing Meetings with Reache

Let’s see how you can manage your meetings with Reache. 

In this tutorial, you will be scheduling a meeting with yourself on your next birthday at 12:01 AM.

**Note**: You must have completed [Tutorial 1: Managing Contacts with Reache](#231-tutorial-1-managing-contacts-with-reache).

1. In the command box, type `find t/me` to find yourself in the contacts list. If you followed [Tutorial 1](#231-tutorial-1-managing-contacts-with-reache) correctly you should see your name as the first search result. <br><br>
2. Now, type `meet for/Birthday in/Office on/<YOUR BIRTHDAY IN DD-MM-YYYY> 00:01 with/1`. <br><br>
3. You will see your newly created meeting in the right panel, like so: 
![New Meeting Created](images/Tutorial/new_meeting_created.png)
4. Let's say you want to update your meeting to invite your best friend. Add their contact if you have not done so. <br><br>
5. Type `list` to see a list of all you contacts. 
![List View](images/Tutorial/list_view.png)
As you can see, for this particular user, their best friend `Barry Ng` is at index position `2`. Similarly, find the position of yourself and your best friend. <br><br>
6. Type `update <BIRTHDAY MEETING INDEX> with/<YOUR INDEX> <YOUR BEST FRIEND'S INDEX>`. For example, this user would type `update 1 with/1 2`. The updated meeting panel should look like this: <br><br>
![Updated Meeting](images/Tutorial/updated_meeting.png)
7. Let's say you change your mind and want to cancel this meeting. <br><br>
8. Type `cancel 1`. The meeting will disappear from the panel, like so:
![Cancelled Meeting](images/Tutorial/cancel_birthday.png)
Now you are all set to manage your contacts and meetings using Reache!
